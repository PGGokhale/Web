## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework a visualization dashboard website is created using visualizations I have created in a past assignment. Specifically, plotting Weather data.

In building this dashboard, I have created individual pages for each plot and a means by which I can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. It also has a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
